# Performance-Benchmarking-of-Cryptographic-Mechanisms
This project is designed to measure the performance of various cryptographic mechanisms, specifically AES, RSA, and SHA, by evaluating the time they take to process files of different sizes. The benchmarks are implemented using Python and cover encryption, decryption, and hashing operations.
